# Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm - Catalog Placements Assignment

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm** using JavaScript. Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic method for distributing a secret among participants. A subset of the shares is required to reconstruct the secret.

## Introduction

The objective of this assignment is to implement **Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm** using **JavaScript** to split a secret into `n` parts. Any `k` parts can be used to reconstruct the original secret. This ensures security in distributed environments.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/shamir-secret-sharing-js.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd shamir-secret-sharing-js
    ```

3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## Usage

1. **Dividing the Secret**: You can input a secret and specify how many parts (`n`) to split it into and how many parts (`k`) are required to reconstruct the secret.

2. **Reconstructing the Secret**: Combine any `k` shares to reconstruct the original secret.
